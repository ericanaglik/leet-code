''''THE PROBLEM'''
''''''''''''''''''
'''Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.'''

# Example:
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].

'''My problem solving strategy:'''
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

# Step 1 -> Restate the problem in your own words:
# Given an array of integers, find and return the indices of two numbers that add up to a target number 

# Step 2 -> Ask clarifying questions:
# What if there are no numbers that add to the target, what do I return?

# Step 3 -> State your assumptions:
# I assume that each input has exactly one solution
# I assume i cannot use the same element twice 
# I assume each number appears only once 
# I assume there ARE two numbers that add up to a target and I don't have to return none or null

# Step 4 -> Brainstorm solutions
